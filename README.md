I built a petition, which consists of a multi-page website. A new user starts at the registration page as shown below:

Next, the user is directed to the petition page, where one can virtually write their signature onto a canvas to support the cause of saving African Wild Dogs. From here, the user is directed to the thank you page where one can navigate to the signers page, edit profile page, delete signature page or simply logout.

The petition is hosted on heroku where you can also sign and join the cause (give it a few minutes to load):
